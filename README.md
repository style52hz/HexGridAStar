# HDTA*: Hexagonal-grid Density-aware Turning-penalized A* 

This repository provides an open-source reference implementation of **HDTA\*** for the manuscript:

**“An Enhanced A-Star Algorithm with Obstacle Density Awareness for Hexagonal Grid-Based Off-Road Path Planning”**

## What is included
- Core planner (hex grid, density-aware heuristic scaling, turning penalty)
- Original interactive/visualization scripts used during development (kept under `scripts/`)

## Quick start

### 1) Create a clean Python environment
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
